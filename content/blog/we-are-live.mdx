## The Journey Begins

Hey there! I'm Rayen, and I'm super excited to share some big news with you. Today marks the official launch of entretien-ai.com 1.0, and honestly, it feels a bit surreal typing these words.

Like many of you, I've been through the technical interview grind. Those late-night coding sessions, the anxiety before system design discussions, and that familiar feeling of "Am I really ready for this?" We've all been there, right?

## Why We Built entretien-ai.com

The tech interview landscape can be overwhelming, especially for entry-level developers. Between mastering data structures, practicing coding problems, and preparing for behavioral interviews, it's easy to feel lost. That's exactly why we created entretien-ai.com.
