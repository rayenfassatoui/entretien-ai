```typescript
interface SoftSkillsFramework {
  communicationSkills: string[];
  teamworkExamples: string[];
  adaptabilityMetrics: string[];
  learningCapacity: string[];
}

const keySkillsToDemo: SoftSkillsFramework = {
  communicationSkills: [
    "Clear technical explanations",
    "Status update delivery",
    "Cross-team collaboration",
  ],
  teamworkExamples: [
    "Code review participation",
    "Pair programming sessions",
    "Project contributions",
  ],
  adaptabilityMetrics: [
    "Technology transitions",
    "Process improvements",
    "Role flexibility",
  ],
  learningCapacity: [
    "New technology adoption",
    "Mentorship reception",
    "Self-directed learning",
  ],
};
```

## Leveraging AI for Interview Practice

Modern interview preparation has been revolutionized by AI tools. Here's how to maximize their benefits:

### 1. AI Mock Interview Sessions

```javascript
// Example AI Interview Practice Structure
const aiInterviewPrep = {
  preparationPhase: {
    recordResponses: true,
    analyzeDelivery: true,
    getFeedback: "Real-time AI analysis",
  },
  improvementMetrics: [
    "Speech clarity",
    "Answer structure",
    "Non-verbal cues",
    "Technical accuracy",
  ],
  practiceFrequency: "3-4 sessions/week",
};
```

### 2. Using AI for Response Analysis

- Speech pattern optimization
- Answer structure improvement
- Body language feedback
- Technical accuracy verification

## Crafting Compelling Stories Using the STAR-AI Method

Combine traditional STAR method with AI-enhanced preparation:

```python
def create_interview_story(situation):
    story_structure = {
        "Situation": "Specific project or challenge",
        "Task": "Your assigned responsibility",
        "Action": "Steps taken with technical detail",
        "Result": "Quantifiable outcomes",
        "AI_Enhancement": "AI tools used for practice"
    }
    return "Polished interview response"
```

### Example: Team Collaboration Story
