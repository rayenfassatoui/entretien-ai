## Mastering Your Design Introduction

Craft a compelling design story using this proven structure:

### The Perfect Formula (DEEP Method)

```plaintext
D - Design Background: Your journey into design
E - Experience: Key projects and learnings
E - Expertise: Design tools and methodologies
P - Passion: What drives you in UI/UX
```

### Sample Introduction Template

```typescript
interface DesignerIntroduction {
  background: string;
  experience: string[];
  expertise: string[];
  passion: string;
}

const myIntroduction: DesignerIntroduction = {
  background: "Transitioned from graphic design to UI/UX...",
  experience: ["E-commerce redesign", "Healthcare app", "Design system"],
  expertise: ["Figma", "User Research", "Prototyping"],
  passion: "Creating accessible, user-centered experiences...",
};
```

## Portfolio Presentation Strategy

### The IMPACT Method for Project Presentation

```typescript
interface DesignProject {
  Insight: string; // Initial research and discovery
  Method: string; // Design process and approach
  Problem: string; // Challenge and constraints
  Action: string; // Design decisions and iterations
  Creation: string; // Final deliverables
  Testing: string; // User testing and outcomes
}

const projectExample: DesignProject = {
  Insight: "User research revealed navigation pain points",
  Method: "Conducted card sorting and user interviews",
  Problem: "Complex information architecture in legacy system",
  Action: "Redesigned navigation using tree testing",
  Creation: "Implemented new IA with responsive design",
  Testing: "Achieved 60% improvement in task completion",
};
```
